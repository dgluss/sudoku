This project is for solving sudoku puzzles using the same sorts of
pattern recognition as a human would use. The primary purpose is for
me to understand what those patterns are, and to build a flexible
framework to manipulate the patterns.

After spending my life programming, I thought it might be time to
review my prejudices as to programming practice and object techniques
without having my livelihood depend on it at the same time.
